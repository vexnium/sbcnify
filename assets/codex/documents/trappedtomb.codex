    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer
So I'm trapped in a tomb. Been here for a couple of weeks, by my count. I can't find the way out. I triggered a secret door and, because secret doors are super exciting, went inside. It closed behind me, and now I'm stuck in some dusty set of tunnels. I'll find my way out eventually, of course, I always do. I'm surprised nobody's rescued me though; I sure have been making a lot of noise."
